AT91SAM7x Board Setup for DiskFreezerX
--------------------------------------

I use an OLIMEX SAM7-Pxxx board with an AT91SAM7256 MCU.
The floppy and the SPI board are found at the 32 I/O Pins of the MCU.

1. Floppy Connection
--------------------

The floppy connector is a 34 Pin header with 2 rows.

The following list gives the wiring of the floppy header to the SAM7x pins:

Floppy Pin		SAM7x Pin		Direction		Comment

	32				PA29			Out			Side Select
	20				PA28			Out			Step Track
	18				PA27			Out			Step Dir Selection
	10 (16)			PA23			Out			Motor On
	14 (12)			PA10			Out			Drive Select
	
	30				PA26			In			Read Data
	26				PA9				In			Track Zero
	8				PA15			In			Index
	
	1,3,...33		GND							Ground Lines

Additionally make sure to power the floppy disk drive correctly.
Modern 3.5" drives only require a +5V supply while older ones also need
the +12V lines.

2. SPI Link
-----------

The SPI link is found on the following pins:

SAM7x Pin		Comment

	PA12		MISO
	PA12		MOSI
	PA13		SPCK   (CLK on beagle SPI)
	PA11		NPCS0  (CS0 on beagle SPI)
	
	GND			GND
	+5V         Supply Voltage
	
You can directly connect these lines to the beagle SPI via the level converter
described in "hw-beagle.txt"
