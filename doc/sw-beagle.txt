Compiling the DiskFreezerX Software for the Beagle Board
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Build dfx-capture
--------------------

The dfx-capture tool resides in "capture/linux".

You need a cross compiler for your Linux distribution running on the
BeagleBoard to build the tool.

I have a Poky Linux setup for my IGEPv2 board.

In your Poky build directory the cross compiler is found in:

poky/build/tmp-poky/cross/armv7a

Make sure to have the cross compiler "arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc" in your PATH.

Then a simple "make" in "capture/linux" will build the "dfx-capture" tool.


2. Run dfx-capture
------------------

* Copy dfx-capture to the root file system of your BeagleBoard.
* Setup all hardware and connect the sampler board via SPI.
* Make sure to have an SPI enabled Linux kernel running
  (see patch in /contrib!).

  > ls /dev/spidev4.0
 
* Capture a single track with:

  > dfx-capture read_trk trackdata

  This will read an capture a single track

* Capture a full disk:

  > dfx-capture read_dsk track

  This will capture all tracks of a disk into the files track_<no>_<side>

* Execute some sampler commands:

  > dfx-capture exec <commands>
